# Impact

The adversary is trying to either steal, manipulate, or delete data. Exfiltration in Azure consists of using techniques to lift resource data from specific resources. This can be done by generating SAS URIs for unauthenticated & persistent downloads, or can be done by directly exfiltrating the data from the resource itself. Deletion can occur through various means.
